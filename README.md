# Data Support Platform README

## Introduction

The Data Support Platform is a comprehensive data governance tool designed to address the challenges associated with managing and processing complex data. It begins with the generation of standardized data output as its primary goal. This platform enables the correlation and integration of data from various internal business systems, establishing corresponding standardized business models by layering data. It encompasses data quality control and algorithm orchestration within the standardized business models to create higher-level models. Additionally, data cleansing is applied to these standardized models to achieve interoperable data standards in today's interconnected world. 

On this foundation, the platform also offers two key modules: Data Assets and Data Monitoring, which provide an overview of the data under the governance of the Data Support Platform. Furthermore, the platform offers unified service capabilities, enabling third-party platforms to access data seamlessly. Overall, the platform significantly enhances the standardization capabilities of hospital information systems, ensuring data security and facilitating future regional healthcare interoperability.

## Key Features

### 1. Integrated Data Collection

- **Data Source Management:** Easily add and edit data sources.
- **Offline Data Collection:** Perform offline, offline incremental, batch offline data collection, and monitor offline collection logs and data volume.
- **Real-time Data Collection:** Monitor real-time data collection logs.

### 2. Integrated Data Governance

- **Data Modeling:** Create custom models, import models, batch import models, and convert models to physical representations.
- **Data Quality Control:** Manage data quality rules and identify erroneous data.
- **Data Cleansing:** Manage data cleansing projects and intelligently generate cleansing plans.
- **Algorithm Orchestration:** Generate orchestration plans by freely combining components such as SQL, FlinkSQL, HTTP, and more.

### 3. Data Asset Views

- **Data Assets:** Visualize data hierarchies, data models, and data previews.

### 4. Data Monitoring

- **Data Aggregation:** Monitor data source and data table activities.
- **Full Data:** Monitor overall data volume.
- **Monitoring Tasks:** Keep track of the status of orchestration and collection tasks.

## Getting Started

To begin using the Data Support Platform, follow these steps:

1. **Data Source Configuration:** Add and configure your data sources for collection.
2. **Data Collection:** Set up offline and real-time data collection tasks.
3. **Data Governance:** Build custom data models, enforce data quality rules, and apply data cleansing as needed.
4. **Algorithm Orchestration:** Create orchestration plans to process and analyze data.
5. **Data Asset Visualization:** Explore data hierarchies, models, and previews.
6. **Data Monitoring:** Monitor data sources, overall data volume, and task statuses.
